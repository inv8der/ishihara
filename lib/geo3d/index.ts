// This module was adapted from the Geometry3D python package (source: https://github.com/GouMinghao/Geometry3D).
// It's been slimmed down quite a bit to support the requirements of this library, but if I ever decide to
// publish it as a standalone package, it'd be worth supporting the full feature set of the original
